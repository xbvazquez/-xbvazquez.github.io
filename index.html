    <h4>GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS: STIMULATE YOUR STUDENTS THINKING WHEN TEACHING ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE</h4>
    <p class="text1">Because much of history is written by those who are not Native, there are distortions to the content that teachers may choose to 
        present to their students. As teachers, it is imperative that you keep in mind the consequences of teaching history and culture through materials
        that may not necessarily accurately represent Native people. With all resources or activities you provide, you should ask your students to think
        about many questions that concern the portrayal of Native people, how authors address Native people, or the tone in which Native people are referred to.
        History about Native people is rewritten in the present or entirely ignored in favor of history that is easily digestible or leads people to believe a
        certain narrative. For Native people in the United States, the history surrounding their people is painful and horrific. However, it is not doing
        justice when our history is distorted to make light of that history so it’s all the more important to be transparent and clear when teaching about
        Native people. Also remember that Native people are not solely people of the past. We are alive now, our cultures are alive, and our communities
        are rich with people who are intertwined and connected through our shared identity. One final point to consider is the generalization of Native people.
        This website uses the term “Native people” very broadly to refer to all groups of people but all tribes are distinct and unique from one another.
        If a specific group is mentioned or is the subject then use the name of that group or tribe rather than a general term like “Native” or “Indian.”
        While this is meant for teachers, anyone who is not a teacher should also take note of these guidelines and do their best to be sensitive. We hope you
        learn a lot from this website!!</p>
